                              <h1>Discovery/Lessons Learn</h1>
                              <p>I observed a lot of concern with the power, speed, and frequency setting on the Epilog Laser.  My suspicion was that speed would have very little impact on the cut quality given the forgiving nature of cardboard. In class, Josh recommended setting Power to 100% and Speed to approximately 25%. With the given setting of 100% power, I decided to prove how quickly the cardboard could be cut. There were multiple comments to Slack also documenting speeds around 25%. <br></p><p> To find the maximum possible speed for my cardboard (0.114") I made a small rectangle vector and began making cuts at various speeds. The key finding was that the power could be increased to a value of 46% while still generating acceptable cuts. The image above (lower left) shows the bottom cardboard layer when the Speed was programmed to 70%. You will notice the top and bottom cuts succesfully cut the cardboard. On the longer edge of the cardboard the cut fades away.  This indicates to me that the laser is as a speed of zero at the beginning and end of the the path. The fade of the cut occurs as the head accelerates. This is an important fact to note if the material you are cutting is sensitive to cut speed. The Epilog laser could have been programmed to move to a location before the path and accellerate into the beginning of the path ensure target speed was achieved before the laser is turned on. If laser cutting a material that is sensitive to cut speed it may be worth evaluating another laser manufacturer.</p>
							  <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>My goal for this project was to create a design that taught me how to further develop my skills in illustrator and understand the laser cutter function. The design I created was not a phenomenal piece of art or a sophisticated engineering marvel. However, there is one piece of the design I value. My title suggest the design attribute that I appreciate.  The infinite loop and the attached illustrator file gives users the ability to create a endless layer of cardboard spheres. Most programmers believe that an infinite Loop is a trap that should be avoided to ensure your program functions. However, as a programmer and father I believe there is one case where an infinite loop is desired. That case is when you are supervising toddler(s) and need to cook dinner, study, fold laundry, etc. In these cases, it is desireable to get your children stuck in an infinite loop. This design would allow me to out spheres with diameters of 2", 3", 4", 5", etc. The children will be instructed to start putting together the spheres.  This is a relatively simple task given the limited number of shapes. The question questions I would expect from my children is "When is it done?" The answer I can't wait to give is a challenge of "Whenever you canâ€™t figure it out anymore."  This challenge I should be provide me atleast 15 minutes to fulfill my responsibilities.</p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>This project taught me some value skills in Adobe Illustrator. The file I created to assemble an entire sphree consisited only off two arcs, a circle, and nine straight line paths. All other paths  that appears in the cutout shown in the image about (lower right) are derived from the previously mentioned paths through the use of transforms.<br></p>
                              <p> After all the validation of necessary speed and power settings I made a mistake returning to the MILL. I swapped the settings of Speed and Power. I can tell you with absolute certainty my file will not cut with Speed = 100% and Power = 30%. Unfortunately, I presumed the laser lens was dirty and requested the staff to clean it. My error was pointed out by the staff. They kindly helped me resolve the issue.<br>
                              </p>
							  <p> The final issue that I have not been able to explain is why I had to "fudge" my slot dimension. I am confident that my caliper reading (0.114") is accurate. However, the slot required for proper fit has a dimension of (0.145"). I suspected there would be inconsistencies in the dimension due to kirf of the laser cut.  However, I would have suspected that commanded cut would need to be smaller, not larger, than the measure dimension.<br>
