                              <h1>Discovery</h1>
                              <p>I observed a lot of concern with the power, speed, and frequency setting on the Epilog Laser.  My suspicion was that there would be very little impact on the cut quality given how forgiving nature of cardboard. In class, Josh recommend a setting of 100% power. With the given setting of 100% power, I decided to prove how quickly the cardboard could be cut. There were multiple comments to the Slack conversation documenting speeds around 25%. I made a simple rectangle vector and began making cuts at various speeds. The key finding was that the power could be increased to a value of 46% while still generating acceptable cuts.  There is one caveat I observed that could allow for higher speeds.  If your paths consisted of several short segments the speeds could be increased, but no performance increase on cycletime would be observed.  I am confident this is accurate because the image of the rectangle above shows the corner cutting correctly and midway through the path on the back side of the cardboard the cut fades away.  This fading indicates the laser head is still accelerating and has passed a speed slow enough to cut through the cardboard.</p>
							  <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>My goal for this project was to create a design that taught me how to further develop my skills in illustrator and understand how the laser cutter function. The design I created was not a Fessional piece of art or a highly sophisticated engineering marvel. However, what it will help me do however one of the beauties of it is its function. As the title suggest this design is an infinite loop and Ken has no limits to its application. My illustrator file is designed so that The circle die this fear size can be increased continuously. A user could theoretically create a huge snowball of cardboard. Most programmers believe that an infinite Loop is a trap that should be avoided to ensure your program functions. Most development violence even a void or check for the potential of infinite loops. I however as a programmer and father believe there is one case where in infinite Loop is desired that case is when you are baby supervising a toddler supervising her toddler children in need to cook dinner do homework for laundry etc. that’s win the infinite loop cardboard cardboard toy is desirable. I will print out spheres of dimensions 12345 etc. inches The kids will be instructed to start putting together this year‘s, a relatively simple task because of the limited number of pieces in the design, the next logical question from any for your old is when is it done? The answer is a simple whenever you can’t figure it out anymore. But that challenge I should be free to spend the next 15 minutes preparing a meal.</p>
                              <p> Second paragraph <br>
                              </p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>Some of the things that I’ve learned to do in illustrator that make using the laser cutter much easier is the ability to transform or duplicate objects with her reference. In the file that I created there was only two arcs a circle and nine straight line pass. All other Path in the illustrator file or derived from each of these components using appropriate transforms. The transforms for also stay in place and maintain their function as the dimensions of the object are modified.</p>
                              <p> One small mistake that I made was miss reading after making my cut validation settings was coming back and running my laser cutting on a separate day. But Eric and Scott the best of me and when I was reading the settings I flipped the power and speed settings. I presume that the laser lens was out of focus because it was only cutting through the top of paper with variables that I believe to be functional and proven to be functional the previous day. My air was recognized after contacting the maker space staff and asking them to verify the lens was clean. They kindly pointed out my hair and I proceeded on producing my final cut which is showing in the image above. <br>
