                              <h1>Discovery/Lessons Learn</h1>
                              <p> I realize when this assignment was created that what I was a train to achieve with my previous Adobe project was actually parameterization. I was unsuccessful in the attempt but it made it helpful that I was already thinking about this strategy when creating this assignment. I carried on with the exact same team from my previous project of a circle with that is used to interlock arches. <br>
                              </p>
                              <p> My first opinion of grasshopper was that it was very difficult to create complex math formulas Without taking up a ton of space on the canvas. However I then found the ability to add C visual basic in python script team into the application. If you reference my source grasshopper file on get hub you’ll find version zero was developed with the scripting and clean up and this version one was developed with the cleanup using visual basic script. The script help avoid an onerous amount of lines connecting all of the objects. It also helped a void items being in the incorrect location I’ll provide for a better layout. This was due to the fact that I could modify the objects to whatever order I deemed necessary for my diagram. In some cases items which were at the bottom or top of the subtraction or multiplication functions were switched for the purpose of creating a clean layout. <br></p>
							  <p>  I think our project name for this week is recycle, reuse, and reduce reduce Reduce. It comes from two separate things first I spent a lot of time figuring out the trigonometry to ensure that all pieces necessary for creating my diagram as tightly as possible on the layout. I had considered using only scrap material And the only input parameters that my grasshopper file would take would be the material Thickness, and the height and width of the scrap material. Grasshopper would they be used to arrange the items appropriately. As an alternative I’m letting the user Select the inner arc to mention and the material thickness.</p>
                              <h1>Arcs</h1>
                              <p>With these dimensions I create the arcs necessary to make a sphere period of Keynote which I am proud of for this assignment is that I also calculated the inner circle radius in the outer circle radius and insured my Linear array direction was in a magnitude necessary to not waste any more material than required. The spacing was done by finding the inner circle drive the line as shown below the formula is also shown below.<br></p>
                              <p> The challenge for this rectangle placement is the fact that the Second rectangle on each arch cannot just be a rotation of 45° of the rectangle on the other end of the arch. I attempted this portrait this was obviously wrong because it placed a rectangle outside the arch. What was needed to ensure its proper placement and generate a good cut was to mirror the rectangle on the end of the arch across the X axis.</p>
							  <h1>Circles</h1>
                              <p>The circles were the easiest part For me to create in this design. However, there was one thing that did make the circle is very difficult and that was the fact that I had the police them appropriately because of the constraint that I put on myself to minimize the waste. There are four circles on the inner edge this was a relatively easy to sign once I was able to determine the location of the beginning. What was the inner arch’s radius divided by the square root of two. With a curved defined by the circles radius knowing the fact that I wanted for circles along that radius it was very easy to create the necessary path to follow. What was much more difficult to calculate what is the appropriate Dimensions of the circle that is the appropriate diameter to ensure that each circle intersects with another circle at only one point. Thanks to the website XYZ.com And knowing the fact that this would be the equivalent of 12 sided polygon Being inscribed in a circle with a radius equal to the inner circle arc minus the radius of the circles.  Derivation of the formula for multiplying and determining the circle diameter necessary based on the inter-radius is shown below.<br></p>
                              <p>  With four circles inscribed on the inside arc The requirements for my design in the six circles to interlock all 12 arcs requires An additional two more circles. The logical space for these to be created is on the inside of this parallel to the existing to center circles. My derivation for the formula Is Sharp allowed to place the lower circle. The inner circle is then created by mirroring the lower circle across the line indicating the X axis.</p>
							  <h1>Challenges</h1>
                              <p>I think that I was not able to complete to my satisfaction for this project was the region different calculation for the arch’s. For some reason this executed successfully for the circles that I was able to subtract the rectangles appropriately. However when attempting to do the same thing to the arc and its corresponding rectangles grasshopper through in the object undefined error. The results generates the same part although it doesn’t help that I decided because there is an unnecessary the point where the rectangle meets the end of the arc.<br></p>
                              <p>One of the things that I expected to generate a lot of problems for me was pretty Ness and needing to shift the design into the proper ask why “thankfully I was able to save myself a lot of time by using the Settings described. The view was a Top  pew with the extens selected. The object was Positioned in the upper left corner and are used a custom scaling Of 1 inch on paper equaling 1 mm in the model. Let’s hope church that even though I was considering inches throughout my document creation process the rhino software was using units of millimeters. This helped sure that everything in my dream was justified to the top left corner of the print page to a PDF which can then be paisley print by transferring the PDF to the MILL computers.<br></p>
                              <p>Depth of cut is half of circle radius. The following modifications had to be made on the fly. height of cutter I thought it would be a .32 .197. Material thickness was change from .194 to .16 for thick material and .017 to .015 for thin material</p>
