                              <h1>Discovery</h1>
                              <p> As I sit here watching my laser cutter run, I’m going to attempt to explain that document that I created for this assignment. This is something that is developed out of my user demand for a way to hold my wife souvenir bats out of all the stadiums she got you. The key challenge that this person is by the souvenir bats is that every stadium has slightly different dimensions or at least over the years as time has passed the souvenir bats have changed and dimensions. My wife still has yet my goal of going to stadiums in the US however since goal has taken longer than expected the souvenir racks or holders at her job for her no longer have the right number of slots because of expansion teams for the right size because types of transfer leaks so. So here comes my goal for this project was to create a chandelier that can hold the bats I am allowed about to be transferred between in the size of each week or team can be adjusted. So chandelier but she thinks that I looked at for chandelier was that it was long in shape it could fit in anyway socket and that could be rotated to allow for adjustments or changes and expansion teams and legal way out.. The other challenge that you’ll see in my project is that I have her put a video showing how about used to not be able to be held by the fish souvenir racks for Dad bill if a team with a small bat was changed to a week with the gate picked up.. So here’s the design that I came up with a bottom plate. That the dimensions of the bottom plate is determined by the largest that size in the smaller bat size will still fit in this and this allows the bats to be set on that platform rather than being held up. The key observation was that the inner small dimension of the bat below the butt end of the handle is actually larger than the butt end of the handle on the smallest bats that we currently own. So sitting the bats on the platform is going to be cheaper for us to be able to successfully hold all of the bats as she eventually can we eventually go to all of the stadiums.</p>
                              <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>I really like the idea on our previous project of trading for amortize variables as a result I attempted to do something similar on this project. However what I found I was very disappointed to realize with Grasshopper was that there are several objects such as ellipsoids tubes and pipes that do not exist in the Grasshopper environment even though they existed right now. But I did find us a alternative to this was to use the happy function the XL function or commandline function within the cats rhino software.  I determine the type of objects that I was going to need and adjusted or found what commands needed to be entered into the command line to ensure that I had all of the variables to fight then as my adjustments changed or I thought of new modifications that need to be added I was able to easily change her self value in excel and quickly copy and paste all text command is necessary to create the objects.</p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>As I reflect on the process to executor project which includes 3-D printers and laser cutters I think there are a few key things that I learned through this exercise. First it was you don’t want to waste the time watching your way watching your 3-D printer room. void breaking for running off the tracks sticky days.<br></p>
							  <h1>Lessons for Similar Projects</h1>
                              <p> I got hasty in building the final socket for the lamp and since I didn’t have a lamp that I planned on putting in there or I wanted it to be the users choice. I ended up making a poor decision when I cut the slots for the vertical supports or stilts. The stilts only had four positions that they could go in. Logical in Blaine was 90° between each one. However there’s 15 teams in each league in the major-league baseball and as a result they should’ve been 24° off of each other and there should’ve been 14 slots for boards. As a result of this decision the bottom and top we’re not able to square up exactly appropriately and as a result amplified the problem of the crooked plywood. I also made six slots assuming that my stilts were going to slide in to the plastic pieces in the end because of her in material size and having a hard time getting it consistent just connected it to and the top and bottom of the piece and didn’t bother creating a notch to slide in and walk it in position. I think walking it into position was the right idea but the scale that was required and necessary print time wasn’t feasible givenThe large crowd of people and printer demand that started Monday morning and continued through to class.
