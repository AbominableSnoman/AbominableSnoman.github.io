                              <h1>Discovery</h1>
                              <p> I know the assignment this week was going to be more challenging due to some of the external factors. I am attended a work conference this week which limited my time in The MILL to Thursday and Friday.  As a result, I tried to choose one of the simplest mechanisms I could think of, a nut and bolt. However, as I sit here in my hotel in Hood River searching Google maps for MakerSpaces in the area to correct flaws in my design I am realizing that a theoretical perfect fit in a drafting program rarely equates to a manufactured to a perfect fit, without accounting for the manufacturing process.
								
							</p>
                              <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>My process began by attempting to find a feature script that would help me produce a nut and bolt. My document was based on the <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6b640a407d78066bd5e41c7a/w/4693805578a72f40ebfb4ea3/e/7886aa5aee640497f4eb6265)" target="_blank">Thread Creator Feature Script</a> found on the OnShape public documents. As you can see in the picture on the right side, there is a theoretical perfect fit when looking at the cross-section view. However, after first printing a part judging from estimates of numbers I assumed would look nice and easy to transport. The document can be found and link showing on the left and by referencing Version 1 in the document history. The actual printed lead screw had several supports generated. These ended up being way too difficult to get off the part. </p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>An interesting discovery was made when I attempted to lay out the parts in Dremel Digilab 3D Slicer. I found that a vertically oriented part took over 4 times (approx. 9 hours) as long to print when compared to a part in a horizontal orientation (approx. 2 hours). Both of these parts generated difficult pieces to work with due to supports and large amounts of material been accumulated in the initial lay ups. My first parts were way too small and the threads were nearly impossible to get into the nut because of the small size. The nut was way too difficult to clean up I decide to go home and regroup Thursday evening and come back another plan Friday.</p>
							  <p>My evaluation focused on the need to ease cleaning up previous parts created. The improvements to minimize this problem created the parts with dimensions shown in row 2 or the photos. As you can see from the picture on the second row the parts were still difficult to clean. A screwdriver and Dremel (a “real” Dremel aka rotary tool) were used to clean the supports between the threads in the nut and bolt. To resolve this issue and was sent back to the drawing board with the realization that I was going to be unable to produce the part because of my lack of available 3-D printers. However an interesting fact is I did find that there’s three Makerspaces either in process of being built or already built in Hood River, Oregon.<br></p>
							  <h1>Lessons for Similar Projects</h1>
                              <p> There are a couple of improvements that could be made to improve part buildup and configuration of the shape to ensure the mating of manufactured parts more closely resembles the properties of the drafted parts.  The first method to improve part creation is turn off the “Generate Support” option in Dremel Digilab 3D Slicer. Dremel Digilab 3D Slicer allows you the option of creating a part without this option However, by default the option is turned on. The Dremel website shows a geodesic ball on their website. The second option was to change the thread style from ISO Square to ISO Standard. This triangle profile would eliminate all of the pinch points.
