                              <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>The concept for my design was to use identical parts 6 times.  Unfortunately, I invested so much time into considering how to design size pieces that could all interlock, I completely overlooked the concept of how the pieces would slide together into the box position. The top picture gives greate detail of how snug the fit is between my pieces and the structural strength that could be derives from the assembly when 4 walls were put together. The slots used to interlock the pieces gives allows a strong interlock compared to the gouges I saw in other designs being fabricated in The MILL.</p>
							  <p>I have some of the pieces and put them together in an OnShape file just to verify that they would fit together appropriately with the design I create. Although these pieces could theoretically fit together, my application of OnShape did not account for the assembly process. That process with small pieces had very litter tolerance. Since I was not able to build a box with all six sites fitting together in the final assembly I meant to say that this was a box designed for stool purposes rather than enclosure. You will notice the top picture is showing the box holding two toolboxes full of tools.  This strength came from 1.5mm thickness FR1.
								<br></p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>Process of creating this box was fairly straightforward if you were able to accurately create a drawing in OnShape. Most of my challenges came from the process of getting the dimensions into Onshape appropriately. Some modifications could easily be made. Once the part had appropriate specifications and dimensions in OnShape, it was easy to export a DXF file, imported to the KiCAD program, KiCAD then plotted to a gerber file which could be imported into Batam software. When turning on power to the Bantam it requires homing and finding the tooltip location. I took over the tool that had been powered on. The second row of pictures shows how an erroneous shape. In my second visit I found it was a best practice to remove the tooltip and install new tooltip, and cycle power on the Bantam machine. This will force the machine to home and find the tooltip.  It became apparent after executing and building and fabricating my one side that took up the entire part that he was going to be a long process to run with my design. To improve the process and cut down on my fabrication time I decided to put six pieces on a single sheet of the FR1.
                              </p>
								<p>When running my second attempt at in the Bantam tool I created an OnShape file with anchored dimension points. This allowed me to quickly change the shape of the rectangle cutout to match the FR1 thickness. Specifying the box position with anchor points rather than trying to drop it in a specific location was something I developed in my second revision. 
                              </p>
								<p>Based on the changes that I just saw and problems I saw other students making one run in the mail I think there are six settings that are absolutely critical when attempting to run the mill. The SIZE settings are defining the material properties (i.e. X, Y, and Z dimensions). Putting these in accurately ensure that the tool knows the available dimensions and it serves as a verification of the drawing that is imported from KiCAD.
                              </p>
								<p>The second group of parameters that I have specified are the X, Y, and Z positions for material PLACEMENT. The Z position of the material defines how deep the mill will cut into the material. Setting this value too large will result in not cutting all the way through your material; while setting it too small will cut into the platform or the base material used to lift the material. You should be able to determine this is the height by measuring in the platform and material thickness and subtracting the material thickness. The X and Y coordinates are used to buffer the cut edge. Values of X=0 and Y=0 will begin cutting in the bottom left corner. I placed an ID along the platform to ensure the material fite tight against the edge of the platform. Because of this, I was able to cut down my placement margin to 2.00 mm. To ensure a margin throughout the entire part I also reduced the actual dimensions by 4 mm. In my Bantam file the material dimensions were entered as 96 x 66 mm.
                              </p>
							  <h1>Lessons for Similar Projects</h1>
                              <p>After running my part through the mill and making a first pass it appeared that the first the top layer of material and scored completely. To recover for this and avoid running an entire circle of material I ran a second pass. The material placement was reduced by 0.20mm and a height material thickness of 0.25 mm was generated. From the pictures in row 3 you can tell how close the materials to run it is getting close to finishing by watching the location of the tool tip. Typically, this gave a better gauge of how close the material was to completing versus the time specified by the Bantam software.</p>
							  <p>If I were going to run through this process I would probably change the dimensions to configuration points. This would allow them designed to be quickly modified based on material thickness. A link to Onshape instructions for configuring configuration points and using equations in the configuration points can be found at the following link. <br></p>
