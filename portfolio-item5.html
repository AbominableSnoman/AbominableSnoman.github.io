                              <h1>Discovery</h1>
                              <p> The concept for my design this week came from the realization I will be graduating from the University of Washington. In a few weeks, my wife is going to be inviting friends and family to celebrate my new-found free time.Somebody in Slack recommended a food grade silicone and ideas started to spin for creating a chocolate candy bar that we could provide the party guests. A design including of the University of Washington, my name, and graduation year seemed logical. Thankfully I was able to find a quickly find <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1871975" target="_blank">Husky STL on Thingiverse</a>. However as my documentation will show creating the husky using a cast model process proved to be very difficult because of the delicate pieces in the design.
							</p>
                              <h1>The Design</h1>
                              <p>Given that the user who created the Thingiverse Husky documented their process of using a 3D printer I was defaulting to this method. I thought the size of the husky would be way too large and not appear correctly in chocolate if I attempted to scale down it’s size. As an alternative, I decided to focus on just the face of the Husky. There are several Google image search results that look similar to the design with “UW” or “W” text overlaid with the Husky.  I was also able to find both OnShape and Rhino documentation showing how to insert text objects that could be extruded to a three dimensional shape. To make what I thought was a feasible design I chose to proceed only with the UW and husky and deleted font containing my name from the design.</p>
							  <p>I anticipated pulling the husky head out of the silicone material would be very difficult. My ideas to address this challenge formed two different solutions. I could either create two silicone molds or create a mold using a backplate and a second piece of the mold as the four vertical walls surrounding the final shape. I also found that one of the challenges would be in how the 3D printer would create the Husky. Most of the documentation for the assignment elude to milling howver, it doesn't explicitly state this as a requirement. Since all of the mills we have been trained on only have three axes (x, y, and z) of motion, I was unable to foresee a way that could create this husky in a mill using only these dimensions of motion. As an alternative, I came up with a solution to split the top of the husky’s head off and print it as two separate objects. As you can see in the image from the result of the 3D printer, I attempted to both lay the Husky on its back facing up as well as stand it upright in print with supports.</p>
							  <h1>The Execution</h1>
                              <p>This project provided me the more challenges with the 3D printer than the previous projects. Some of the challenges that I encounter resulted from not printing a brim on the base of small pieces. These resulted in small pieces slipping from the build plate during the print. The huskies in different orientations proved facing up produced much better results than using supports. The supports are very difficult to cleanup to a professional finish. In the pictures on third row of photos, you will see show the two piece mold that I used allowed me to easily pull the pieces apart. That was the upside of creating the multi-piece mold. The downside was, I lost a fair amount of silicone because the molds were not a tight fight and silicone can creep into even the smallest voids of space. Given this challenge I attempted to create a another mold using the 3D printer. The second attempt can be found in the Rhino files and has a channel at the base between the base plate and the vertical walls. This method only resulted in wasting a bunch of time as the silicone found its way throughout the channel and glued the pieces together to a point that I could not pull them apart.
								</p>
							  <p>With my silicone mold created I thought I was on the home stretch. I read the classmates complaints regarding using plaster I decided to use a material that I thought would be easier to work with, ice. The ice set phenomenally fast compared to plaster.  However,  I missed out on one key benefit of plaster... the ability to use the “screw it and glue it” method. Every ice mold broke apart as it was removed from the silicone. To successfully complete the project with four identical pieces I had to determine that my letters were makeshift sprues in the design. They were so thin when popping them out of the silicone, they broke nearly every single time at some location within the letters.I designed to assign those devices as sprues in my design and cut them off. The resulting shape can be seen in the video above.</p>
							  <h1>Lessons for Use of Process in Future</h1>
                              <p> Given the fact that I decided to work with ice I think there is one key consideration I would have before using this material again. I would consider whether there is any chance the casting will break when removing it from the mold. I lacked the luxury of gluing ice back together and therefore had to result in breaking it to make the shapes identical. There is a small chance that putting a back plate across to all of the UW and husky to hold the pieces together could have successfully cast a single piece from ice. However, my original design was intended to be chocolate but was modified by the fact that I was unable to obtain food-safe silicone in a timely manner: I would have benefited from creating as thick as font as possible and reducing the depth of the letters.. The silicone material does a phenomenal job of getting into all of the nooks and crannies and therefore I now realize that it would have been able to pick up the details of shallow letters on a base plate.
